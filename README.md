Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
```css
@media (min-width: 800px){
    main{
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
        width: 600px;
    }
```

### Continued development

Basically, I'd love to get better at writing media queries and responsive design as a whole
